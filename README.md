# Does-this-Incident-Matter

A deep neural network by us-ing a CNN based model and introducing an attention mechanism for trivial incident prediction.

## Introduction

This project is to implement the deep learning model in the paper, which proposes a deep-learning based approach, called DeepTIP(Deep learning based Trivial Incident Prediction), to prioritizing incidents by identifying trivial incidents and effectively utilizes the three types of features to identify trivial incidents.
